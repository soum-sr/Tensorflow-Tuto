    "These are shallow neural networks that learns to reconstruct data by an unsupervised manner. The first layer is called <b>Visible Layer</b> and the second layer is called <b>Invisible Layer</b>. Its called restricted because the neurons in the same layer are not connected to each other. RBM is a generative model. A generative model specify a probability distribution over a dataset of input vectors. We can do both supervise and unsupervised tasks with generative models.\n",
